<p>This page is for the purpose of people testing my upcoming game, Illusive Dreams. I'd greatly appreciate it if you could give me feedback on the game, especially things you think should be improved. If you'd like to contact me with feedback, just send me an <a href="mailto:michael@nova-fusion.com">e-mail</a> or message me on <a href="http://twitter.com/BlackBulletIV">Twitter</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>A few things I'd really like to know are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the game too hard or too easy?</li>
  <li>Is the difficulty curve too sharp or too shallow? If so, what are the offending levels?</li>
  <li>How's the narrative/story? Could the method of storytelling be improved?</li>
  <li>Is the the performance bad? For example, do you see frame shuttering, freezes, and stuff like that, or is frame rate on the console (see below) below 60?</li>
  <li>Do you notice any other errors such as bugs, visual problems, spelling errors, and so on?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can turn the console on and off by pressing <strong>Q</strong>. This will display information like frame rate, render times, and so on. If you need to reset the stored level data (level times and the last completed level), press <strong>7</strong>, <strong>8</strong>, and <strong>9</strong> together, then proceed to reload the game.</p>

<p>The music you hear was composed by <a href="http://jeremiahpena.com">Jeremiah Pena</a>. The music isn't complete, but it's getting close.</p>

<p>Finally, this game is in no way done (obviously). There are many things yet to be done, such as real sound effects, levels, and other content.</p>

<h3>What's New in Build 5?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Since it's been so long since the last test build, I'm not how many new levels there are, but the last one is level 41.</li>
  <li>New sound effects by Jeremiah. There are many still to be done, of course.</li>
  <li>Background layers are blurred a bit, creating somewhat of a static depth-of-field.</li>
  <li>Changed the menu background.</li>
  <li>Arrows have red tips for much easier visualisation.</li>
  <li>As usual, many other modifications, fixes, etc.</li>
</ul>

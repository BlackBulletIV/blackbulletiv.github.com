<p>This page is for the purpose of people testing my upcoming game, Illusive Dreams. I'd great appreciate it if you could give me feedback on the game, especially things you think should be improved. If you'd like to contact me with feedback, just send me an <a href="mailto:michael@nova-fusion.com">e-mail</a> or message me on <a href="http://twitter.com/BlackBulletIV">Twitter</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>A few things I'd really like to know are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the game too hard or too easy?</li>
  <li>Is the difficulty curve too sharp or too shallow?</li>
  <li>Is the the performance bad? For example, do you see frame shuttering, freezes, and stuff like that?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can turn the console on and off by pressing <strong>Q</strong>. This will display information like frame rate, render times, and so on. If the frame rate is below 60 I'd appreciate if you let me know.</p>

<p>Finally, note that (obviously) this game is in no way done. There are only 8 levels in this test build, and there's no sound except for a few temporary 8-bit sound effects.</p>

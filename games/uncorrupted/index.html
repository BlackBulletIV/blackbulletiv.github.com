<p>Uncorrupted is the game I created in less the 48 hours for <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare</a> 22, in which it scored place #34 out of around 720 entries (here's the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=top&amp;cat=Overall">top 50</a>). It's a platformer/shooter kind of game, where you're a robot (who's remarkably human-like in thinking) with no idea where or who you are. It's apparent that you're in some kind of research facility. It's also apparent that all the researchers are dead, lying on the ground. But why?</p>

<p>When playing, make sure to read all the notes, logs, and boards, as most of them either contain information as to what happened, or real-world references.</p>

  <p>Pixel Says is a Simon Says remake implemented using only one pixel for graphics, which you can play to the right. It was made using <a href="http://flashpunk.net">FlashPunk</a>, in around an hour and a half.</p>
  
  <p>If you want to get technical, the graphics are stored in an image buffer with dimensions of 1x1; this buffer is then scaled up by 400 so you can see it at a good size.</p>
  
  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  
  <p>In case you don't know how to play Simon Says, here's a little instruction. Once you start the game, a colour will appear; repeat this colour by pressing one of the colour buttons (1, 2, 3, or 4). Then the first colour, followed by a new colour will be displayed; you must then repeat both in sequential order. This process will keep repeating, and the aim of the game is keep up with the pattern for as long as possible.</p>

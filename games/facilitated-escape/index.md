title: Facilitated Escape
---

This game was created in less than 48 hours for the 21st [Ludum Dare competition](http://www.ludumdare.com/). The theme for the competition was "Escape", and therefore this game revolves around you escaping a collapsing facility in your rocket. The challenge comes from dodging oncoming "blocks", so you need to keep your eyes peeled. It has a retro style to it, with pixel art, pixel fonts, 8-bit music, and retroish sound effects.

You can find all the source code for the game at [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/facilitated-escape).

Nevertheless, I'm sure you can learn something by checking it out, so feel free to poke around the source.

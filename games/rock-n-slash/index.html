<p>Rock 'n' Slash is a game I created in less than 48 hours for <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare</a> 23. It's a simple arcade game where your goal is to stay alive and increase your score by killing enemies with your gun and sword. Since the theme for Ludum Dare 23 was "Tiny World," the game takes place on a tiny island in the sky. Enjoy!</p>

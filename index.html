<h2 class="h1-5">Hello there!</h2>

<p class="large-para">I'm Michael, a web developer/designer, game developer, programmer, and in general, a technology enthusiast. I create websites, games, programs, and other things in the realms of technology. Want to learn more? Check out the <a href="/about">about page</a>.</p>

<div class="span-8">
  Be sure to check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a>, on which I post tutorials, updates on projects, and other things. For other outlets of mine, you can find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/BlackBulletIV">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/BlackBulletIV">YouTube</a>.

  On <a href="http://github.com/BlackBulletIV">GitHub</a> you can find the source code for many of the open source things I'm working on, or have worked on. Most of it either being code for developers, or open source games I've released. On the <a href="/projects">projects page</a> you'll find pages for some of them (the ones I think are worth showing). Check it out and see what you can find.

<div class="span-8 last">
  I have an interest in most everything creative: art, music, video, and especially games, which in many ways brings them all together. You can find the games I've released on the <a href="/games">games</a> page. For now these are just <a href="http://ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a> entries or experiments, but more will come eventually.

<h2 class="h1-5">Hello there!</h2>

<p class="large-para">I'm Michael, a web developer/designer, game developer, programmer, and in general, a technology enthusiast. I create websites, games, programs, and other things in the realms of technology. Want to learn more? Check out the <a href="/about">about page</a>.</p>

  On <a href="http://github.com/BlackBulletIV">GitHub</a> you can find the source code for many of the open source things I'm working on, or have worked on. Most of it either being code for developers, or open source games I've released. On the <a href="/projects">projects page</a> you'll find pages for some of them (the ones I think are worth showing). Check it out and see what you can find.

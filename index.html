<h2 class="h1-5">Hello there!</h2>

<p class="large-para">I'm Michael, a web developer/designer, game developer, programmer, and in general, a technology enthusiast. I create websites, games, programs, and other things in the realms of technology. Want to learn more? Check out the <a href="/about">about page</a>.</p>

<div class="span-8">
  <p>On <a href="http://twitter.com/BlackBulletIV">Twitter</a> I post updates on various things, such as the status of projects, new blog posts, or random thoughts I might have.
  
  <p>I've got a <a href="/blog">blog</a> here too, on which I post tutorials, updates on projects (which are longer than 140 characters), and other various topics.</p>
</div>

<div class="span-8">
  Apart from web related things, I make <a href="/games">games</a> and <a href="/music">music</a>. Not too long ago I released my first complete game, <a href="/games/facilitated-escape">Facilitated Escape</a>, which I made in a two week period. As for music, I don't compose something very often, due to being busy with other things, but usually every month or two I'll come out with something.

<div class="span-8 last">
  On <a href="http://github.com/BlackBulletIV">GitHub</a> you can find the source code for many of the open source things I'm working on (most of it being code for developers). On the <a href="/projects">projects page</a> you'll find pages for some of them (the ones I think are worth showing). Check it out and see what you can find.

Yesterday I recorded and released a 10 video tutorial series how to use my ActionScript 3 library, AMFPHP Toolbox. I've been meaning to do this for ages, but, you how it is. You can view all the videos at its [YouTube playlist](http://www.youtube.com/user/BlackBulletIV?feature=mhum#p/c/30526DF66C1E2C84).

Due to AMFPHP kindly [tweeting](http://twitter.com/amfphp/status/3754383707738112) about it, and a number of others retweeting ([1](http://twitter.com/dannykopping/status/3754605498339329), [2](http://twitter.com/peterelst/status/3755239538692096), [3](http://twitter.com/fabbrikk/status/3799696422211585), [4](http://twitter.com/barakadesign/status/3821779210477568), [5](http://twitter.com/marsspider/status/3858746711212033) - thanks guys!), there's been a _big_ upward spike in my visitors graph. In fact, I've never had this many come on to the website ever.

Anyway, I hope you find the tutorials useful. Let me know what you think!

This morning I released strong 1.0.2, which adds three new methods to the mix: `camelize`, `center`, and `underscore`. `center` is the complement to `ljust` and `rjust`, and the others are from Rails' extensions to Ruby's String class. Take note, they aren't yet documented in the function reference.

Anyway, go and grab 1.0.2 at its [repo](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/strong). Enjoy!

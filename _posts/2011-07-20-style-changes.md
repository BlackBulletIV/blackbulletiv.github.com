I've beefed up the styling a fair bit on the website, especially regarding the menu. The colour scheme is now different; I've gone for more "modest", grey look. The text is now a little bluish, and the the links are darker.

So anyway, that's about it for now. I'm hoping to have a bit more to say (or time to write it more like!) in the future.

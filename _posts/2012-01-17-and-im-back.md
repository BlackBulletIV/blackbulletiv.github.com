The holiday was great for the most part, and as always, it's good to be home again. But the main thing I want to talk about is the things I've been working on while away. First of all, I worked on Illusive Dreams a bit, adding levels 34 to 38.

But the thing I got the most done on would be my library for [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org), [Ammo](http://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo). I'm not sure whether I've mentioned it on my blog before, but it's an organisational library with some helpful utilities. It's still in development, and has been on and off for a number of months.

I've been tweaking and fixing things in the code, and have begun writing documentation for it, which can be found on its [wiki](http://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo/wiki). So far the documentation for [`ammo`](http://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo/wiki/ammo), [`input`](http://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo/wiki/input), [`World`](http://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo/wiki/World), and [`Entity`](http://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo/wiki/Entity) has been written. I except the first version to be released somewhat soon.

Anyway, that's all for now.

I haven't posted for the last couple weeks, as I've been working on converting my website to Jekyll, and also on Launcher, both of which are taking a long time.

Anyway, today my good friend Patrick Crawford released his [independent film][film] (or, brickfilm, as it's made in LEGO) entitled, "Design Flaw". This is from its description on YouTube:

> My independent film, slightly under two years in the making, is based upon the themes experimented on by Aldous Huxley and George Orwell in their inspirational novels, Nineteen-Eighty-four and Brave New World, respectively. This story is not directly relevant to those storylines, but it does expose a theme not highly expressed in either novel, another flaw. In a perfect world, a mistake is made. How can a such an efficient society deal with such occurrences, and what are the costs of it's own perfection?

The film deals with a number of interesting themes, and I think it is very well executed (with the exception of a few troubles he had with blue screens and the designer's microphone). A number of years ago I used to make brickfilms myself (nowhere near this quality though), and it's a very tedious process, even when the production quality isn't high.

Anyway, in case you missed the link here it is: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZI3sc8GNQ][film]

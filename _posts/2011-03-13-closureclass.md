I've recently created an experimental Lua object-orientation library using the [closure approach](http://lua-users.org/wiki/ObjectOrientationClosureApproach) to OOP. It's based largely on MiddleClass, sharing a lot of design features with it.

I've already written a README, so go and visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/closureclass#readme) for more information.

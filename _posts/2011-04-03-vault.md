Well, this morning I created a little library for [L&#214;VE](http://love2d.org) called Vault. This library is about data storage (as in persistent data storage), and it allows you to store and retrieve data in native Lua data types. If you want to learn more have a read of the [README](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/vault#readme) over at its [repo](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/vault). I'll also be adding a project page for it sometime soon.

Enjoy!

**EDIT:** The new project page is over here: [projects/lua/vault](/projects/lua/vault)

Well, it's been quite a while. As always, there's a lot I've been wanting to do but haven't, sometimes due to procrastination, other times actually being busy, and more than occasionally a cocktail of both. I've planned to do a comprehensive tutorial series on LÃ–VE itself for ages and I'd written the first one or two parts for it, but now I've just found out that [0.9.0's been released](http://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=76646), so that sets it back even further.

Surprisingly enough I haven't been solely twiddling my thumbs in the intervening time. I've spent far too much time playing a game entitled [PlanetSide 2](http://planetside2.com), partially due to the responsibilities of leading an outfit (or, group) in it. Due to that I embarked on probably my biggest web development project yet, a [website for my outfit](http://thebloodwolves.com). It's a custom system built on CodeIgniter which hooks into PlanetSide 2's API; pretty cool stuff, and an awesome learning experience.

I've also been doing a little video editing (the [outfit's trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU54S0KNjrw) probably being my best work), experimenting in [photography](http://instagram.com/blackbulletiv), and [composing music](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsEUR7l6GzmDa_xjA2Xq40OyKZGmgV3dM).

However, this year everything will be slowed down considerably, as I've switched from homeschooling to a proper school to finish my senior years. Thus a lot more time will be chewed up, especially once HSC kicks in.

Anyway, that's all for now... just an update. I hope to write a bit more here in the future, but I've probably said that in the past, so no promises.

I've been working on a number of things lately (hence why I haven't posted for a month), one of those things being a new game, which I'll be talking about in this post. After completing [Facilitated Escape](/games/facilitated-escape), I spent a few days wondering what game I should create next. This is where I've got with my idea so far:

{% youtube F-i0C9jkGWg %}

As a warning, YouTube has darkened the video a great deal, the game is actually lighter. Also, I'm a bit tired in the video, so I do rattle on a little.

If you don't want to listen to me talk for too long, here's the general idea. The game's a platformer, and is heavily story-based. The environment you play in is representational of how the guy's life is going at that time in the story; if it seems like life is great, it'll be sunny and green, if not, it'll be dark and gloomy. When things are dark and gloomy, there are hazards to navigate, such as arrows, spikes, and the like. Finally, the guy tries to forget the darkness by finding pills which turn the night into day. There's a lot more to it, but I won't give too much away.

Anyway, I've been working on the game for around four weeks now, and I'm certainly learning a great deal. I've still got sound effects, music, story, more art, and more functionality to do, so I expect to be working on this for at least two or three more months.

I'm making it with Flash, so it'll of course be a free-to-play game. My plan is to pick up a sponsor at a site like [flashgamelicense.com](http://www.flashgamelicense.com/), so I can hopefully make a little money off it, and then release it. Whether that goes as planned or not, we'll see.

Finally, I've got plans to port Facilitated Escape to Flash. Now that I've got used to FlashPunk again, it shouldn't be too hard to pull off. Exactly when that'll happen I don't know as I'm pretty busy with this platformer at present.

Anyway, thanks for reading!

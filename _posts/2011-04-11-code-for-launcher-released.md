I thought I'd release the code for "Launcher" in its current state for the public to muck around with. Note that, as expressed in LICENSE.txt (make sure you read that), that this **only applies to its current state**. Meaning that you have _this_ code under the terms of the BSD license, but don't have any future code under its terms. I know this is obvious, but hey, we live in a confusing, wacky, legal world.

Anyway, you can get it here: [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/22660566/launcher.zip](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/22660566/launcher.zip)

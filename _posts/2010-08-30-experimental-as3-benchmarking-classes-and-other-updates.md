I just thought I should probably post an update on my blog. The big thing I forgotten to post about on here is the release of a package of three experimental AS3 classes, targeted at benchmarking. They gather information on two topics, FPS (Frames Per Second) and the time between points in time. I won't re-describe what I already have here, so I'll point you to its [project page](/projects/flash/benchmarking). As stated, sorry for lack of documentation; this should change in the future.

Also, I should note that I'm going to be away for two weeks starting August 31. I will most likely have no computer access and therefore won't be able to do very much in the technological realm.

After I get back, I plan to work on getting better instructions out on using [AMFPHP Toolbox](/projects/flash/amfphp-toolbox), my AS3 library for enhancing the use of AMFPHP. Anyway, that's about all for now.

Well, I'm going away on a holiday with the family for a couple weeks. I doubt I'll have internet access for most of the time I'm away, so there'll be no activity from me accordingly. Nevertheless, I'll probably be working on projects such as Illusive Dreams in my "spare time."

Anyway, have a good time internet! :)

I've been working on a little game (in the [L&#214;VE](http://love2d.org) game engine), which for now I'm calling "Launcher". The core gameplay mechanic is this: you are a circle, which can stick to certain surfaces, and then launch yourself at great speed off them in the direction of the mouse. It's completely controlled by the mouse, you aim with it, and the distance between the player and the mouse determines the speed of launch.

On my [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/BlackBulletIV) I've already posted three gameplay videos of the work done so far. Here's the first:

And the second shows off a destructible player:

The third is the most exciting so far. It displays a rough level editor, and some more exciting gameplay (due to the ease of creating blocks):

That's about it for now. :)

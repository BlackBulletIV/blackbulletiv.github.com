Now this gameplay video I'm pretty proud of. I've now added some very rough sound, generated with CFXR. This is also the first time I get to display a much more awesome level; because I'm telling you, it takes a lot of skill to play this kind of level with a screen recorder running, with all the jerkiness in framerate.

The screen recorder also caused a few physics problems a long the way. At two locations you'll see the player stick to nothing, but note that doesn't happen normally. Also, the game froze and crashed at the end, I think this is due the screen recorder hogging the CPU.

But that aside: enjoy!

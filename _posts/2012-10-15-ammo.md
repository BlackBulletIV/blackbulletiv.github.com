This announcement post is a bit overdue, but, better late than never. A short while ago, I released the first version (0.1) of [Ammo](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo), my organisational library for [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org). Its current version is 0.1.3. I plan to let the library stay in the 0.x range for a while as it's tested by me and any others who use it.

Along with the core library, there's a number of extensions available. The one I'm most excited about is [ammo-debug](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo-debug), a versatile, highly customisable debugging console. It provides stuff like output logging, a command system, info graphs, and even simple live coding support. At present its version is 0.2.

So, if you want to find out more about the library or its extensions, I'll leave you with a list of links:

* [Repository](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo): Repository for the core library.
* [Wiki](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo/wiki): Wiki containing documentation for the core library.
* [ammo-physics](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo-physics): An extension that allows you to connect Ammo's worlds and entities to love.physics.
* [ammo-debug](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo-debug): A versatile, highly customisable debugging console.
* [ammo-input](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo-input): A simple input mapping extension.
* [ammo-tweens](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo-tweens): A tweening extension.

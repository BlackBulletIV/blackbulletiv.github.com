Well, I'm back, alive, almost entirely functioning, and trying to settle into a routine. I had a generally good time with some friends and family up in the Brisbane and Sydney areas. Some negative points were a couple minor colds, and some of the most aggravating kids I've ever had the bane of knowing.

As usual, nothing has really happened in the realm of my projects while on the trip. If I wasn't talking, doing stuff with friends, sitting in the car, or trying not to die in Super Crate Box, I was probably studying C++. 

But anyway, that's about all there is to say. Hopefully I'll get some cool stuff done in the near future.

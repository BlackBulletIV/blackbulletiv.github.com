This is just a post announcing that [Ammo](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo) 1.0 has been released ([changelog](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/ammo/wiki/Changelog)). After a couple months in the 0.x range, I feel it's ready to be pushed up to 1.0. Hopefully soon I can create some tutorials for the library; the documentation is complete and up-to-date, but documentation isn't particularly good at conveying the big picture.

Anyway, if you've got any feedback on the library, please let me know.

A couple days ago I felt like doing a quick game for a little change from the game I've been working on for the last seven weeks. For some reason, I decided that limiting myself to only one pixel would be a cool idea. So last night, in an hour and a half, using [FlashPunk](http://flashpunk.net), I put together a Simon Says remake called [Pixel Says](/games/pixel-says).

Obviously, the only thing that I wasn't able to do successfully with one pixel is have instructions given inside the game; other than that it was perfectly possible to do.

Also, I recorded my screen the whole time since it was a very short time period, so I may upload that footage later on.

Anyway, that's all for now. In case you missed it, you can play the game at [its page](/games/pixel-says).

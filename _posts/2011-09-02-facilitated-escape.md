This post is to announce the release of the first version of my game, [Facilitated Escape](/games/facilitated-escape) (other than the one submitted to Ludum Dare). I've been working on it for nearly two weeks since I started work during Ludum Dare 21.

The game revolves around escaping a collapsing facility in your rocket, dodging oncoming "blocks" that are in your path. It's got quite a retro feel to it, with pixel art and 8-bit music.

Anyway, I won't repeat what I've already written, you can get more information and download the game from [its page](/games/facilitated-escape). Also, I'd really like to hear your comments and suggestions regarding it.

Enjoy!

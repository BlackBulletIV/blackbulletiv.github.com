Well, it's been some time since I've released a test build for Illusive Dreams hasn't it? Work on it has been very slow lately; both I and Jeremiah haven't done all that much on it during the last few months. Nevertheless, a lot has happened to the game since the last test build, and I thought it best to release a new one before I go off to Brisbane. You can find the build here: [/games/illusive-dreams/test](/games/illusive-dreams/test). Any feedback, suggestions, etc., would be most welcome.

I don't know when the game will be finished, but not soon. For now, I'm treating it like a bit of a background project while I do other things.

Anyway, enjoy!

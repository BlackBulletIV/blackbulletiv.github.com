It's about time for another update post on my platformer, Illusive Dreams. As you may guess, I've finally found a name for the game.

The main thing I've been working on is the levels for the game, with the first seven already done and two others which I'll use later on. I don't think I'll be making a hell environment, as it seems to be too much work right now (this is a free game after all).

And here's the latest video log showing the first five levels:

Finally, if you want to help me out by testing the game please contact me; I'd greatly appreciate it.

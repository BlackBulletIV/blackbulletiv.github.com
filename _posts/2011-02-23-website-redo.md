My website hasn't been that active at all lately, due to me being busy (as always). I decided to give the website some attention this month, but instead of posting updates or anything, I've been working on a complete overhaul. This site now runs on WordPress, which is much better, more dynamic, and easier to use than my custom made CodeIgniter slap-together. The blog and website are now merged into one, as in, they run on the same system and have the same theme.

Expect to see more of the website popping up soon.

## Skills

I can work with the front (browser content) and back (server code) end of web development. I started off doing this, using all the standard technologies like [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), and [SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). I haven't done much with PHP lately, favouring [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) instead. I also know Flash and ActionScript well too; I used to do a lot with those technologies (I authored the [AMFPHP Toolbox](/projects/amfphp-toolbox) library).

I know a good variety of programming languages too. [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) is my favourite, I know the guts of [Lua](http://lua.org) very well, and I know [Python](http://python.org) pretty well too. As for compiled languages, I know [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), some [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29), and can read Objective-C, but I haven't done much in these, preferring interpreted languages.

I've been experimenting with game development the last few months, using the [Love2D](http://love2d.org) engine (which I know how to use very well) mainly, picking up a tonne of information along the way.

For other libraries and frameworks, I can use [MiddleClass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass) (I'm a contributor to it), [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com), [SFML](http://sfml-dev.org), [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [AMFPHP](http://amfphp.org), and [TweenLite/Max](http://www.greensock.com/tweenlite).

I've used [Joomla](http://joomla.org) and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) to create a number of websites (note I don't really know their PHP APIs). For operating systems I have experience in both Mac and Windows, Mac being my current operating system.

If any have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

## Me

My name's Michael, I'm a web developer, programmer, and freelancer (under the company name NovaFusion), living in Victoria, Australia. I love technology, mainly because of the awesome it lets you create (without the need of a big crew), the interactivity that's possible, and the ability to distribute your products to millions of people around the world. I love to learn new things, and there's certainly a lot to learn in technology!

For other activities, I like bike riding and other forms of exercise. I've been playing the guitar for a little while as a musical instrument, I've been picking the piano/keyboard lately, and have been composing [pieces of music](/music) here and there. I enjoy studying science, especially when it's related to physical things like matter, energy, time and the like. Finally, I enjoy using mathematics to solve problems in life, mainly for my programming tasks.

As for my spiritual beliefs, I'm a Christian who believes in God and His Son. It's this that keeps me going, and affects every decision I make. I have a deep interest in topics related to God, and enjoy discussing them.
